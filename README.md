## Installation
There is *no* installation script provided with this. Installation is done via the [urn-settings](https://github.com/mellowawa/urn-settings) tool.

In urn-settings you can simply press on the button labled "install theme", it should give you a drop down menu where you have to choose "Other...", it should than give you a filepicker. <br>
From there simply go to where you have stored the `kawaii-urn` folder (note that this folder must be the one containing the css file, not the folder of the repo), Select it, once you click "Save" it sould install the Theme.
